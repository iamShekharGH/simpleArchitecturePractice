So i found this playlist on youtube and it seemed like a good project to follow. Ive gotten a bit rusty with android development and this kind of helps me out with that.
Rules are simple :~
 - So i'll follow this playlist from youtube video by video. 
 - Won't copy paste any code.
 - Will run this on device before commiting to main branch.
 - I must commit once every day.
 - I'll try to summarize my takeaway from this playlist, once i am done.

this is the playlist i am following to practice/ learn how to develop with modules.
